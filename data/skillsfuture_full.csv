Children will have purposeful opportunities to become absorbed and engrossed, develop skill of concentration and perseverance. A self-directed learning environment not only provides opportunities to apply learning from other curricular areas, but also helps children to work collaboratively, which can be transferred and applied to all learning that takes place in the centre, at home and in all aspects of life. Thus, paving the way for lifelong learners.","At the end of this course, participants will be able to:

The space sends a message that getting to know one another is important, constructing expectations of how we work, live and play in those settings. Effective environments are comfortable, interesting, attractive and appropriate for the child, holding intrinsic interest and giving children myriad ways to practice and refine skills across all aspects of learning.  A self-directed learning environment is about children having opportunities to choose, extend their play, interest and learning. Children will have purposeful opportunities to become absorbed and engrossed, develop skill of concentration and perseverance. A self-directed learning environment not only provides opportunities to apply learning from other curricular areas, but also helps children to work collaboratively, which can be transferred and applied to all learning that takes place in the centre, at home and in all aspects of life. Thus, paving the way for lifelong learners.\n\n# course learning outcomes\nAt the end of this course, participants will be able to:

1.	Recognize the effects of learning environments on preschool-age children.
2.	Identify features of learning environment that help preschool-age children feel secure, comfortable, welcome and ready to explore and learn.
3.	Acquire knowledge on how to design and maintain a developmentally appropriate environment for preschoolers.\n\n# course entry req\nLON Certification Status: L1 , L2 , EY2

Before proceeding with branding and developing a brand strategy, it is important to distinguish between your business and your brand. Your business is focused mainly on generating revenue while your brand is the visible and experiential aspects of your organisation as perceived by your internal and external stakeholders.

Branding is how you present and position your brand to your stakeholders while brand strategy is the long-term planning behind the development of an irresistible and successful brand. Brand Strategy comes before and informs the branding process; it takes into consideration what the brand stands for, what it promises its stakeholders, how it conducts itself internally and externally, etc.

In today’s digital landscape where communication is two-way, the development of the brand becomes a co-creation process with its stakeholders. Brands have to accept that they are no longer in total control, and that the best way forward is to work with their stakeholders to build a winning brand.

Brands also need to be vigilant regarding what they put out and what their stakeholders are saying about them. When something goes wrong, brands need to take the necessary steps to resolve it quickly. This is especially critical in our cancel culture as it may result in a boycott of your products and services as well as long-lasting damage to your brand reputation.","• Minimum age: 18

The use of storytelling techniques in content advertising has become increasingly popular in recent years, as marketers seek new and innovative ways to engage audiences and build brand awareness. However, using storytelling effectively requires a deep understanding of the principles and techniques involved, as well as the ability to adapt narratives to meet the needs of different platforms and audiences. According to HubSpot1, the use of storytelling in advertising requires a clear narrative structure, relatable characters, and a consistent tone and style.

The course is developed by keeping in mind that the nature of learning is constantly evolving and changing. Schools are now preparing students for jobs that do not exist yet, or for taking on multiple unrelated jobs that require unlearning and re-learning in a lifetime. To achieve this, schools will focus on the long-term competencies and skills that will enable students to be ready for tertiary education and subsequently embark on their career. Optimizing learning and memory processes is one of the important keys to unlocking an individual's learning potential and preparing them for opportunities and challenges ahead. This course employs emerging research on learning and memory science, focusing on the ways in which humans process, maintain, and apply knowledge. Possessing an understanding of the pathways that underlie learning and how our memory works will help participants understand why certain learning techniques work and how to adapt their lifestyle and health towards improved learning, thinking and creativity. It also helps teachers to develop best practices for lesson plan design and assessments that enhance student learning by reinforcing the retention of information. The course will be conducted as a workshop. Participants will learn firstly about how the brain works generally,  followed by a deeper understanding of the neuronal basis of learning and memory.

It begins with understanding an organization’s sustainability needs, goal-setting using SMART principles, and applying Locke and Latham’s goal-setting theory. The ESG business environment is explored through global sustainability trends, the UN SDGs, and consumer behavior. Policies and frameworks, such as Singapore Green Plan 2030, Germany’s Climate Action Programme, and the European Green Deal, provide regulatory context. The curriculum includes analytical tools like the Modified BCG Matrix for sustainability and change management models such as ADKAR and McGuire’s persuasion model. It delves into ESG standards, including GRI, ISSB, and ISO 26000, alongside policies like Singapore’s Carbon Pricing Act and Europe’s carbon tax. Risk and opportunity management is addressed using scenario analysis, risk matrices, and mitigation strategies. Sustainability strategies are covered across environmental (ISO 14064-1, ISO 50001), social (ISO 26000, CSR plans), and governance (ISO 22301, ISO 37001) domains. Stakeholder engagement is emphasized through impact assessment models.

Describe the use of health screening and other related tools in the assessment of employee well-being. 2. Employ Total Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) principles to implement behavioural intervention programmes.\n\n# course learning outcomes\nTotal Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) is the Singapore framework to promote worker safety, occupational health, and wellness. It is an evolution of the traditional view that worker health is only about safety at the workplace. The framework encourages companies to view worker health holistically and provides guidance on the assessment of worker’s Total WSH needs as well as the implementation of intervention or preventive programmes.

Building on top of the Introduction to Total WSH as the foundation, this course allows participants to acquire the understanding and principles of health and related tools for employee wellbeing in an organisation. With this understanding, participants will then be able to implement behavioural intervention programmes by employing the tools of the Singapore Assessment-Intervention-Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (A-I-ME) methodology as part of the Total WSH framework.\n\n# course entry req\n- Completed Introduction to Total Workplace Safety and Health (WSH)

One of the existing heavily researched cryptographic tools is the zero-knowledge proof. Zero-knowledge proofs are currently in excessive development, both in terms of theoretical machinery but also practical implementations, and have the potential to scale blockchain-based solutions securely. Additionally, a standardisation effort for zero-knowledge proofs is currently in progress.  Zero-knowledge proofs refer to a cryptographic protocol where a party can prove possession of certain information without revealing the information itself. Most learning materials struggle to explain why they are important and how they work internally, so zero-knowledge proofs remain somewhat “magical” and elusive, deterring developers from effectively exploring or utilising them in a big span of projects. In this course, we will focus on the mathematical and cryptographic foundations of zk-SNARKs, a type of commonly used zero-knowledge proof. The acronym zk-SNARK stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”, and the course will focus on every development step of the Groth16 zk-SNARK.","At the end of the 2-day course, participants will be able to:

One of the existing heavily researched cryptographic tools is the zero-knowledge proof. Zero-knowledge proofs are currently in excessive development, both in terms of theoretical machinery but also practical implementations, and have the potential to scale blockchain-based solutions securely. Additionally, a standardisation effort for zero-knowledge proofs is currently in progress.  Zero-knowledge proofs refer to a cryptographic protocol where a party can prove possession of certain information without revealing the information itself. Most learning materials struggle to explain why they are important and how they work internally, so zero-knowledge proofs remain somewhat “magical” and elusive, deterring developers from effectively exploring or utilising them in a big span of projects. In this course, we will focus on the mathematical and cryptographic foundations of zk-SNARKs, a type of commonly used zero-knowledge proof. The acronym zk-SNARK stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”, and the course will focus on every development step of the Groth16 zk-SNARK.\n\n# course learning outcomes\nAt the end of the 2-day course, participants will be able to:
▪ Explain the capabilities, limitations, and applications of zero-knowledge proofs
▪ Analyse arithmetic and algebra for cryptographic building blocks
▪ Assess elliptic curves and review elliptic curve pairings
▪ Dissect Groth16 zk-SNARK setup, prover, and verifier stage
▪ Design statements to be proven in Groth16 zk-SNARK and build them in different representations (algebraic circuits, Rank 1 Constraint System (R1CS), Quadratic Arithmetic Programme (QAP))
▪ Construct Groth 16 zk-SNARK setup, prover, and verifier
▪ Use SageMath for mathematical calculations and Circom for zk-SNARK calculations\n\n# course entry req\nNil\n\n"

The Course Objectives for students taking the two (2) courses, as extracted from the original approved 2018 Course Proposal, are: • To develop strategic skills for BIM project planning and implementation • To look forward to career advancement and Job Role opportunities as a BIM Specialist, Coordinator or Manager • To become the organisations’ BIM Strategist Planner for BIM adoption and BIM Execution Planner to BIM manage building projects during design and construction phases.  The Course Objective of both courses, NSBML &amp; NSBM, are to boost the level of BIM competency skillsets and expertise in the BE industry of Singapore and deepen the BIM management skills and knowledge of the students to enhance their Job Role career progression in the company.  This is achieved through the institutional-based learning at SP conducted as part-time night classes for the adult learners over three nights per week.  The Course Objectives remain unchanged as they are still relevant to the current and future needs and demands of the BE industry in line with the BCA’s ITM initiatives and IDD aspirations.  The Course Objectives also align with BCA’s Integrated Planning and Design (IPD) initiative which states the following two (2) objectives:  a. Drive collaborations across value chain to enable better planning from the onset and optimise building design for downstream construction and maintenance. b. Create a conducive environment for collaboration and regulatory submissions through common data standards with a data-rich BIM model that is used across the project lifecycle.

IDD builds on the use of BIM and Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) to drive the needs of the BE industry from design to construction to asset management stages, covering four main areas:

a. Digital Design - To achieve design objectives through coordinated design to meet client’s, regulatory and downstream construction requirements.
b. Digital Construction - To achieve delivery, installation and monitoring of on-site construction activities to maximise productivity and minimise rework.
c. Digital Asset Delivery and Management - To achieve real-time monitoring of operations and maintenance to enhance asset values.
d. Digital Fabrication - To achieve translation of design to standardised components for automating off-site production.

The core curriculum structure and framework of both NSBM and NSBML courses are based mainly on the above IDD objectives in Digital Design and Digital Construction.

• Consequence of Failure (COF): How the potential failure could affect the people, equipment and work environment
An RBI risk assessment should be able to identify the following:
• What damage could occur
• Where it could occur
• How quickly will the deterioration spread
• Which piece of equipment is likely to fail first
• What impact that would have

It helps to prioritize their equipment for inspection, optimize inspection methods and frequencies, and implement effective inspection program (such as repair or replacement of equipment) and risk mitigating measure commensurate with the risk contribution and equipment condition.
This training introduce the participant RBI framework and methodology to establish and implement a risk based inspection program based on API 580 principles best suited for the company objectives.

This course is to facilitate the business to: •	Formulate the logistic strategies for becoming a collaborative enterprise that is driven by the needs of future warehouse digitization and automation. This futureproof transformation necessitates different sets of practices as well as a greater need for interdisciplinary talent to drive facilitation with various stakeholders in order to make aligned logistics solution implementation and optimization with those ever-changing situations. •	Devise a monitoring and optimization plan based on time, cost, and resource indicators for various logistical activities such as warehouse distribution and fulfilment, inventory planning and control, and transportation. These indicators must be in accordance with operational policies, optimization activities, metrics chosen, business resources, and logistics strategies. They should elicit the optimization of distribution bottlenecks, changing customer expectations, and market cost trends that may have an impact on business profitability. •	Leverage on best practices from their framed operating model to preach the benefits of end-to-end, well-integrated business processes in transportation, warehouse distribution, and inventory in order to analyse and optimise information sharing and connectivity activities.

They need that well-collaborated logistic solutions that can integrate with production to shape demand, refine inventory requirements, deliver production output toward winning strategic goals, and maintain Logistics Resilience. This allows them to operate not only in Singapore, but also to maintain their competitive performance in terms of delivering the right manufacturing outputs at the right costs in the face of all types of market fluctuations and Logistics Changes. This begins with strengthening workforce resilience and agility in dealing with Logistics Resilience - collaboratively solutioning, analysing, and optimising logistics in the manufacturing context - while taking external business influences, production constraints, and distribution bottlenecks into account. This necessitates a structured collaborative process, to entice everyone to work cross-functionally across the organization as a whole, to stay on top of all changes.

So, implicitly or explicitly, we negotiate everywhere in our daily working life and that’s why knowing how to negotiate to make deals and resolve conflicts is so important for business professionals.

Thanks to an interactive format, this workshop aims at improving participants’ analytical and interpersonal skills in negotiation and conflict management, and make sure they do first things first. They will learn how to utilize their own negotiation strengths and focus on key areas of improvement. Combining lectures, interactive discussions and hands-on activities, it will enable participants to develop cutting-edge negotiation/ conflict management strategies and be equipped with powerful influencing, persuasion and conflict resolution skills""\n\n"
